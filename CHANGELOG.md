### Bug fixed
- Check `nil` msg to add diagnostics to ignore them. [c255272](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/c2552728add8cca4ae342fcfd125f276b602daeb)
- ~~Add current file path to detect in `get_filepath()`~~. [8bf2c86](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/8bf2c865b50674073fd6f68ee2c2be175485eeba)
	- But it is weird because `/**/` must include current directory.
	- This function will not removed.
- Check `pdf` file is existed first before `view()` starts. [734e704](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/734e7040ea61af46395e2e9ab98232b518efddb6)
	- It will prevent to open empty file.
- Unify drive character also for Windows in `sep_unify()`. [77e0ef3](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/77e0ef34da991b6238d74eb34ba13db17b4b8c77)
- Use `texflow.io` to initiate serverdata at plugin startup instead of python script. [c5c7826](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/c5c78265737009b5a7809c8d21cd7406b162afb4)
	- It Will cause fast plugin loading times.

### ReFactoring
- Push commands to one side in commands.lua for lazy loading functions. [24236f6](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/24236f65f7d4107427f37484d56a3f77a82b07ca)
- Separate progress/notifying function to `notify.lua`. [3cd4e6c](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/3cd4e6ceeaee9c23067bd7e12198fe5438208e75)

### Features
- Show progress message dynamically when compiling. [786ab31](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/786ab319d9f5ad94ab023a886834821a35c69cfb)
	- Required `fidget.nvim`. If not, notification use `vim.notify()`
- Clean up auxiliary files process is added before `compile_core()` using `compile_safe()`. [88380fb](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/88380fb0712c457e8a3aeba86e418631032bce5e)
- Add `pdfTeX warning` message pattern for warning diagnostics. [0b735e6](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/0b735e6d428af17c08b30e01fae7857a0d0541a1)
	- Add `Package <package name> Warning ~` pattern at [9e19622]()
	- Add `warning ~ ` pattern [9e19622]()
- üî® **_Breaking changes_** : Now `texview.nvim` supports for multiple file project directory. [9e19622](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/9e19622c1fa3f5c321c9bf9ea658886fd8b975ac)
	1) Check diagnostics for multiple files and show them whenever the file which has error is loaded.
	2) Support `@maintex` and `@curtex` tokens.
		- The existing `@tex` is changed to `@curtex` to distinguish.
		- `@maintex` will detect main file in project by some sequence.
		  but there are limitations that only one file allows to `@default_files` in case of setting by `.latexmkrc`.
	3) Getting `filedata` will be fast. Remove dependency from argument.
	4) Reconstruct `parser.py`, It dedicates to process whole file without slicing for multiprocessing.
	5) Add `check_max_print_line()` to adjust maximum column of log file
		- It aids to proper parsing file path in log file.
		- It only supports for MikTeX. TeXLive users must adjust them in `texmf.cnf` manually.

	- now `-file-line-error` of `latexmk` doesn't be necessary option.
	- Some errors are not converted to format of `<filename>:<line>:<msg>` with `-file-line-error`
- Fix bug that invoke error when *.tex buffer is deleted after viewer is closed first. [478f092](https://github.com/Jaehaks/texflow.nvim/commit/478f092fa81c698b95820e589d9be5ea175c5cd9)
